# Symfony demo with mutagen

This repo aims to show how to use [docker][1] with [mutagen][2] when working on
a php project.

## Setup

See [devdock](./devdock/README.md) to install dependencies.

```shell
$ make      # start
$ make down # stop
```

Project available here: https://symfony-demo.dev.localhost

## Remark

All the docker's conf are in the [devdock](./devdock) folder and can be
outsourced.
